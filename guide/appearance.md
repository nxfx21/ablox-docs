# Appearance

## Themes

The **Appearance** page lets you customize the look of the entire app by pasting CSS into a text box. Since AppleBlox uses [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) components, you can use any [shadcn-ui theme generator](https://ui.shadcn.com/themes) to create a theme and paste the CSS directly.

You can also find pre-made themes shared by other users on the [AppleBlox Discord server](https://discord.gg/appleblox).

## App Icon

Customize the AppleBlox icon in your Dock. The app ships with several bundled icon designs, and you can upload your own `.icns` files.
