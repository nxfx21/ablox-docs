# Multi-Instance

::: danger Unsupported Feature
Multi-instance is very buggy and is no longer actively maintained. It is kept in the app but has not been updated. Roblox has been cracking down on multi-instance usage, so it may not work at all.
:::

Multi-instance lets you run multiple Roblox windows simultaneously, each in a different game or server.

Find it under **Behavior > Multiple Instances**.

1. **Enable Multi-Instance** - Enables multiple Roblox windows.
2. **New Instance** - Opens an additional Roblox window.
3. **Close All** - Force-closes every Roblox window. Shows a confirmation dialog first, since this will interrupt any active sessions.

No support is provided for this feature. If you run into issues, refer to the [AppleBlox Discord server](https://discord.gg/appleblox) for community-sourced workarounds.
