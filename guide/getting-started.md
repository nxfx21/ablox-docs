# Getting Started

AppleBlox is a macOS-exclusive Roblox launcher that enhances your experience with features like Discord Rich Presence, server region selection, mod support, multi-instance launching, and more.

::: info System Requirements
Requires macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) or later. Available for Apple Silicon, Intel, and Universal architectures. If you're using a version older than macOS 11, you can access AppleBlox through your web browser using the dedicated button to avoid a critical bug affecting the desktop app.

## Installation

1. Download the latest `.dmg` for your Mac from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/AppleBlox/appleblox/releases).
   - **Apple Silicon** (M1/M2/M3/M4) - `arm64`
   - **Intel** - `x64`
   - **Universal** - works on both, larger file size
2. Open the DMG and drag AppleBlox into your Applications folder.
3. Launch AppleBlox. On first launch, macOS may block the app. See [I can't open the app](/guide/faq#i-can-t-open-the-app) in the FAQ for solutions.

If Roblox isn't installed yet, AppleBlox can download and install it for you. Click the **Install** button at the bottom of the sidebar when prompted.

## Onboarding

On first launch, a guided setup walks you through the essentials:

![Onboarding screen](/images/getting-started/onboarding.png)

1. **Activity Settings** - Toggle server location notifications and Discord Rich Presence.
2. **Roblox Account** - Optionally connect your account (unlocks recent games and region selection).
3. **Behavior Settings** - Configure delegate launching, background updates, and closing behavior.
4. **Join the Community** - Link to the official Discord server.
5. **FastFlags Notice** - Important info about Roblox's flag whitelist.

You can skip steps and change any of these settings later. After onboarding, you'll land on the **Quickplay** page.

## The Sidebar

The sidebar is your main navigation. It stays on the left side of the window at all times.
